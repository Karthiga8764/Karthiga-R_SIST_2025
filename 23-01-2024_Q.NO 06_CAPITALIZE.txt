#You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.

#Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

#Input Format

#A single line of input containing the full name, .

#Constraints

#The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.
#Note: in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.

#Output Format

#Print the capitalized string, .

#Sample Input

#chris alan
#Sample Output

#Chris Alan



#LOGIC 1:
def solve(s):
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word in the string
    capitalized_name = ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split())
    return capitalized_name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    s = input().strip()

    result = solve(s)

    fptr.write(result + '\n')

    fptr.close()



#LOGIC 2:

def solve(s):
# Use the title() method to capitalize the first letter of each word
    capitalized_name = s.title()
    return capitalized_name

# Input
full_name = input()
result = solve(full_name)

# Output
print(result)
